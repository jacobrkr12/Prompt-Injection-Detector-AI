# Prompt-Injection-Detector-AI
Development of an AI using Scikit-Learn and PyTorch in Python. Hyperparameter tuning using both TF-IDF and BERT embeddings. 99.73% accuracy on dataset but still in development.
# Dataset
This AI is currently running on a small dataset. It has neither been trained with names of organizations nor malicious prompts outside of authentication info. Currently, one may find this AI easy to manipulate but future updates and improvements will make it much more reliable.
